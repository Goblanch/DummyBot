A Discord Dummy bot that says Hello, counts the members in a Discord server and list them

# Desciption

The first Discord bot I've made using discord.py python library. To use it you have to create an application in 
the Discord developer portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications).

I've used this tutorial to create the application for the bot.

In the main.py script you need to add your bot's token to get it running.
